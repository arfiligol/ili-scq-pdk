# Materials And Technology

`ili-scq-pdk` is responsible for public superconducting process semantics. The
PDK should make material and technology data easy for simulation workflows to
consume, but it should not duplicate a full solver framework.

## PDK-Owned Data

The PDK owns:

- public layer names and layer numbers;
- layer views;
- layerstack z positions, thicknesses, and material names;
- public material records and aliases for the SCQ process;
- cross-sections and port conventions for public examples;
- schema/export helpers that let solver packages consume PDK materials.

Current public material data exists in `ili_scq_pdk.tech.material_properties`.
When `materials.json` is introduced or imported, it should remain a first-class
data source rather than a generated afterthought. It should be schema-validated
and treated as part of the public PDK contract.

## Existing Ecosystem Material DB

The local `gsim` fork already has a common material database and resolver:

- `gsim.common.stack.materials.MaterialProperties`
- `gsim.common.stack.materials.MATERIALS_DB`
- `gsim.common.stack.materials.get_material_properties`
- `gsim.common.stack.materials.resolve_material_at_wavelength`
- `gsim.palace.materials.resolve_palace_materials_at_frequency`

It also supports a PDK overlay lookup path. That means the integration direction
should be:

1. Keep SCQ material records in `ili-scq-pdk`.
2. Export or adapt those records into the `gsim` material overlay/schema.
3. Upstream reusable adapter support into `gsim` when it is not PDK-specific.
4. Keep Palace-specific material evaluation in `gsim`, not in the PDK core.

`gplugins` also has material utilities for existing plugin workflows. Use it
when the capability belongs to the broader plugin ecosystem rather than the
simulation workflow layer.

## Palace Support Surface

For Palace electrostatic, EPR, reporting, and surface-Q index mapping, the PDK
should provide:

- stable layer semantics for conductor, dielectric, vacuum, and simulation
  boundary layers;
- material names and material properties that can be resolved by solver tools;
- layout provider metadata that lets public workflows select a public or
  private layout case;
- documentation and notebooks that show how the workflow is wired without
  publishing private layout/IP.

Reusable Palace execution, report generation, and benchmark analysis belong in
`gsim` unless the capability is only a PDK data export. This prevents the PDK
from becoming a solver orchestration repository.

## Meshing Direction

Meshing strategy should follow the reusable `gsim` direction. PDK docs should
describe required process/layer/material inputs, but mesh generation logic
should not be duplicated in `ili-scq-pdk` when `gsim` provides the correct
route.
