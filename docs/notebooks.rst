    :description: Public notebooks for the ili-scq-pdk open superconducting quantum/RF PDK.

These notebooks are publication-safe examples built from the public PDK and
public layout-provider API. They avoid private chip layouts, GDS inputs from
private designs, run artifacts from private workflows, and lab-specific layout
packages.

Private resonator, AS reference qubit, and AS circular qubit V3 simulation
notebooks belong in the private layout repository until their public workflow
surface can be demonstrated without publishing layout/IP. This repository
documents the public provider boundary and keeps notebook examples safe for
GitHub Pages.

    .. grid-item-card:: NB-001 Public PDK Quickstart

        :doc:`notebooks/public_pdk_quickstart`

        Activates the open PDK, builds public demo components, and inspects the
        public layout-provider manifest.

    .. grid-item-card:: NB-002 Resonator Workflow

        Status: private source pending.

        The public version should exercise provider-safe resonator simulation
        without exposing private layout geometry.

    .. grid-item-card:: NB-003 AS Reference Qubit Workflow

        Status: private source pending.

        The public version should document the workflow shape while keeping the
        private qubit layout in the private layout repo.

    .. grid-item-card:: NB-004 AS Circular Qubit V3 Workflow

        Status: private source pending.

        The public version should become available only after a provider-safe
        public surface exists.
