# Docs Publishing

The public documentation is part of the PDK contract. It should be buildable
locally and published through GitHub Pages for `arfiligol/ili-scq-pdk`.

## Tooling

The docs stack follows the Quantum-RF-PDK publication pattern:

- Sphinx for documentation builds.
- MyST-NB for notebook pages.
- Jupytext `py:percent` notebooks stored in `notebooks/src/`.
- `docs/docs.just` for docs helper commands.
- GitHub Actions for pull request validation and Pages deployment.

The docs intentionally use `ili-scq-pdk` branding and content. Static assets
should be added only when they are needed for this PDK.

## Local Build

Run:

```bash
uv sync -p 3.12 --group docs --extra dev
just docs
just docs-latex
just docs-pdf
```

`just docs` builds HTML into `docs/_build/html`.
`just docs-latex` builds LaTeX source into `docs/_build/latex`.
`just docs-pdf` builds the PDF from the LaTeX source.

The generated Just command reference is included below when the docs are built:

```{literalinclude} justfile_help.txt
:language: text
```

## CI Contract

The GitHub Pages workflow should:

- build HTML docs on pull requests and pushes;
- build LaTeX and PDF artifacts;
- upload the HTML artifact for review;
- upload the PDF artifact for review;
- deploy Pages only from `main`;
- include the PDF in the published Pages output.

Pull requests validate that architecture pages, notebook pages, and API pages
render without requiring private layout repositories.

## Content Checks

Before publishing an architecture change, verify:

```bash
rg -n "/Users/|private[ ]GDS|private[ ]benchmark|run[ ]folders|NCUAS_SC_Qubit_Design" docs README.md
```

Any matches should be intentional. `NCUAS_SC_Qubit_Design` may appear only as
an explicit local workspace example or first-consumer context. Absolute local
paths, GDS inputs from private designs, benchmark values from private layouts,
and private run directories do not belong in public docs or public examples.
