# Issues

This page tracks ecosystem issues that matter to the `ili-scq-pdk` workflow.
Items may later become upstream GitHub issues or PRs. Do not add private layout
details, benchmark values from private layouts, or private run directories here.

:::{grid-item-card} ISSUE-001 Palace report ownership
:link: issues/palace-report-ownership
:link-type: doc

**Repo:** `gsim`

**Related features:** FEAT-001, FEAT-004

Reusable Palace report generation should live upstream instead of in a private
layout repo or inside the PDK core.
:::

:::{grid-item-card} ISSUE-002 Material schema boundary
:link: issues/material-schema-boundary
:link-type: doc

**Repo:** `gsim`, `ili-scq-pdk`

**Related features:** FEAT-003

The PDK should own SCQ material records and aliases. `gsim` should own reusable
material resolution and Palace-specific evaluation.
:::

:::{grid-item-card} ISSUE-003 GDSFactory plugin boundary
:link: issues/gplugins-boundary
:link-type: doc

**Repo:** `gplugins`

**Related features:** FEAT-001, FEAT-004

Generic GDSFactory plugin helpers should not be duplicated in the PDK. Move
only reusable plugin integration into `gplugins`.
:::

:::{grid-item-card} ISSUE-004 Quantum RF reference parity
:link: issues/quantum-rf-reference-parity
:link-type: doc

**Repo:** `Quantum-RF-PDK`

**Related features:** FEAT-005

The SCQ PDK should keep package discovery, docs publishing, public samples, and
GDSFactory+ metadata aligned with the ecosystem reference shape without copying
branding or solver scope.
:::

:::{grid-item-card} ISSUE-005 Private provider acceptance tests
:link: issues/provider-acceptance-tests
:link-type: doc

**Repo:** `ili-scq-pdk`

**Related features:** FEAT-006

Public tests should verify the provider contract and entry-point loading
without importing the private layout repo.
:::

:::{grid-item-card} ISSUE-006 Integration branch hygiene
:link: issues/integration-branch-hygiene
:link-type: doc

**Repo:** `gsim`, `gplugins`, `Quantum-RF-PDK`

**Related features:** all upstream-facing features

Prototype branches may move quickly. Upstream PR branches should be rebuilt
from upstream `main` and contain only one human-reviewable feature slice.
