# Palace Analysis/Reporting Contract

**Target:** `gsim`

**Status:** candidate

Reusable Palace electrostatic and EPR report generation should live in `gsim`.
The PDK should provide layer, material, and provider metadata that these reports
can consume without depending on private layout repositories.

Acceptance direction:

- report APIs work with public provider cases;
- private providers can validate the same workflow without publishing layout;
- generated reports avoid private paths and benchmark data from private layouts
  by default.
